# KoiOJ

Two years ago, I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't waste any time on meaningless CRUD projects during my four undergraduate years. In a sense, I broke that promise. Although most of this project was completed through vibe coding, I still spent a considerable amount of time on it. However, I discovered that my (or the LLM's) implementation was so clumsy and convoluted, and I seemed to have no way to make it beautiful. Perhaps CRUD isn't entirely meaningless repetitive work after all.

Anyway, this is my first relatively formal CRUD project. Obviously, this is purely a student project, unsuitable for production environments (maybe temporarily, but most likely permanently). Nevertheless, it is feature-complete.

KoiOJ is yet another Online Judge platform.
